--HOW TO CALIBRATE YOUR MICROSCOPE--

you will need:
    - a microscope
    - an object of known width or a pair of calipers

method

step 1: if you are using calipers you should set them to 1mm and tighten down the tension.
step 2: start up the program
step 3: place your object or calipers over the microscope sensor
step 4: press the pause bind (defualt: 'p')
step 5: this is the hard part, click on one side of your object and then click on the opposite side in the same location,
        if you are using calipers you should measure across the back tips used for internal features.
step 6: look at your console, there will be a pixel readout; divide this number by 1000 and set your scale (in local_settings.py) to that.
        if you are not using calipers set to 1mm then you should divide by the size of your object in microns instead.
step 7: congrats, you should now be set up correctly.
step 8: to check your settings measure your objet again and look at the readout, if it matches your object's size then you are good to go.
        if not then repeat steps 5 and 6.

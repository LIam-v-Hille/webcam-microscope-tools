This program is designed as a simple utillity for a usb webcam microscope,
this is not an in-depth guide on how to make one but in short it can be done by removing the lens of a webcam
and optionally flipping it end-for-end (only possible on some models of webcam).

if you have a webcam microscope then here's how to use this software,
first thing to do is to calibrate it, consult 'calibration.txt' for how to do that.
once that is done you can do the fun stuff, placing samples on your microscope you can, measure it by clicking on any two point (right-click to clear your measurement from the screen),
take a picture of your subject (optionally with a measurement) by pressing the screenshot key (defualt: 'i'). 
it is also possible to pause updating the screen with new frames (useful if you have a shaky hand) this is done by pressing the pause key (defualt: 'p')

any setting that should be modified can be found in 'local_settings.py'
to run the program simply run 'main.py'
